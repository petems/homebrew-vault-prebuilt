# Inspired from the .travis.yml in
# https://github.com/davidchall/homebrew-hep/

# This script can be executed in three different modes:
# - cron/api (api is when you select 'trigger build' in travis): in this mode,
#   all the formulas are tested to make sure that there is no shared lib
#   breakage
# - push to master: does nothing
# - pull-request: in this mode, the updated formulas are built and bottled
#   and the bottles are pushed to bintray as 'unpublished'. The DSL commit
#   is pushed as a tag, e.g., 'pr-1234', which us unrelated to master.

# (1) remember to use 'brew cleanup -s' at the end of the travis script;
# otherwise, the $HOME/Library/Caches/Homebrew folder will be enormous
# (~2GB for the 4 jobs). This is because this folder is already present on
# osx images and it is big.
# (2) For a time, I had removed $HOME/.cache/Homebrew (cache of Linuxbrew)
# because it was also storing some logs in $HOME/.cache/Homebrew/Logs, making
# the cache rebuilt every time.

# WARNING: I discovered that 'set -e' is breaking Travis CI. I was using for
# stopping a multiple-lines command as soon as one of the commands fails.
# After having 'set -e', internal travis commands may stop working, e.g.:
#   /Users/travis/.travis/job_stages: line 57: shell_session_update: command not found
# is an internal error that shouldn't stop the script for continuing, but
# because of 'set -e', the whole internal Travis CI script stops.
# Conclusion: avoid using 'set -e' and more generally avoid for-loops and
# multi-line commands that should fail when one of the commands fails.
